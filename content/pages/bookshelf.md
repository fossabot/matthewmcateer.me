Several group houses I've lived in have had massive libraries. These have included contributions from past and current house members. While this results in a pretty impressive display, I often find myself at a loss when someone brings up the inevitable "Which books do you recommend?". Alas, I often find  myself struggling to put together an immediate response. With that in mind, I've assembled a list of books that I've read. It's worth noting that just because a book appears on my list, does not necessarily mean I endorse its content. Where possible, I've tried to include a few sentences on my thoughts on the books. Hopefully I will someday have enough time to write mini-reviews for a more-than-negligible fraction of these books.

Since the books I've read lack any overarching order to them, so does this list (I apologize in advance):
