In OpenAI's "Requests for Research 2.0", the OpenAI team lists a few interesting ideas. Here's an example of one:

>‚≠ê Implement a clone of the classic [Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDbTP0B94AM) game as a [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment, and solve it with a [reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) algorithm of your choice. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/openai) us videos of the agent playing. Were you able to train a policy that wins the game?

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7ubc3f/d_requests_for_research_20_openai/

In the grand scheme of OpenAI's research requests, this one is in the category of "warmups". With that in mind, I figured making the thought process behind this publically available would help others in trying to get to the more advanced requests.
