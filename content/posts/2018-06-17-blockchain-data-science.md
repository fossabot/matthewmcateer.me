If you've been in tech (or at least have watched HBO's "Silicon Valley"), you're probably familiar with all the buzzword-tossing. Stephen Wolfram, in an April Fool's Day ["Buzzword Convergence" post](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/buzzword-convergence-making-sense-of-quantum-neural-blockchain-ai/) on his blog, even tries to make sense of what a "Quantum Neural Blockchain AI" would even involve. Lately some of the biggest ones have been the buzzwords "Blockchain" and "Data Science". It seems that many founders' primary strategy is to string a bunch of these words together in hopes of presenting prospective investors with something unique. 

With that in mind, I have the somewhat dubious honor of being an actual "Data Scientist at a Blockchain Company".

You've probably seen my past post on where Social media has gone downhill, and where some recent advances in distributed systems could help with this. This may satisfy some technology enthusiasts, but there are technologists out there that are genuinely looking for guidance on how to actually build up one of these projects. Partly inspired by Stephen Wolfram's blog, what follows is a tutorial on how to actually apply data science techniques to "blockchain" projects.

In the time since this post was written, I've compiled these results into a Google Colab, which you can run right in your browser.
