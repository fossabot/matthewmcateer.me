Longevity startups are gaining much more traction. The longevity space is getting large enough that one can think of it being divided into different verticals.

## What is Forever Labs?

Forever labs is focused on the aspect of stem-cell based therapies. Not a specific therapy, but rather making stem cells available for any potential therapies.

## The Setup

The procedure costs either $5,000 upfront, or $500 for the first year, and $250 for consecutive years. I know that theoretically means that the latter option would be much higher, though truth be told if it turns out I pay more because Forever Labs successfully stored my cells for 18 years, I can’t really see myself getting mad about something like that.

Option of donating to research, an option similar to the rationale behind Alcor’s cryogenic freezing

I went with the bone marrow procedure. There are options to instead process stem cells from fat from liposuction, though in my case theThe procedure for bone marrow 

Regret not having enough for liposuction

No swimming after the procedure (or dunk tanks or anything else in long list)

## The Procedure and Aftermath

I went into the doctor’s office. This was a regular doctor’s office in San Francisco at 450 Sutter St.  (I was actually amazed to find out the building the doctor was in had a wikipedia page, but I digress). I took some of the pain medication they gave me about 30 minutes before the procedure, filled out the necessary paperwork acknowledging the difference between Forever Labs and the doctor doing the harvesting procedure, and was welcomed in. It was refreshing to see that this procedure had been done many times before. In fact, aside from the storage methods this was functionally indistinguishable from a bone marrow biopsy.

I went in. The doctor had a wonderful habit of explaining out loud everything he was doing to his assistants. As I lay on my stomach with my pants partially down, the doctor used an ultrasound to find the spot on my pelvis where the 6 mm needle was going to be inserted, and then marked the spot with a surgical marker. The next few minutes involved sanitizing the area and injecting local anesthesia. The anesthesia affects the pain receptors, but not the pressure receptors, so while I did not feel pain from the needle being inserted, I could still feel the sensation.
Next came the actual removal of the bone marrow. This was when a wide syringe was inserted into the hole in my bone and the plunger was pulled back. At this point, the conversation between me and the doctor went something like this:

> Doctor: “Now, we’re going to start removing the bone marrow. This might feel a little weird”

> Me: “Weird? What do you mean weiiiiieeeeoooOOOOOOOOHHHHHWWWEEEEEE!!!”

Well, he wasn’t wrong. Curiously enough this was one area that the pain medication and local anesthetic did not seem to affect. I’m not quite sure how to describe the pain, only that it felt almost like a reverse pressure pain. When the doctor asked what the pain was on a scale of 1 to 10, I answered about a 7. This was apparently normal, as the range apparently fell between 5 and 8 for most of the patients he had seen. Luckily it was over very quickly. Plus, I had definitely experienced far worse pain at the hands of a medical procedure than anything this involved.

After everything was closed up, and my lower back was covered in copious amounts of waterproof medical tape, the doctors made sure I took my time when it came to rolling off of my stomach, sitting up, and then bringing myself to a stand. It seemed unnecessary at the time, but I know it’s the unexpected cases which are why they do this.

Recovery was surprisingly quick. After I thanked the doctor and left the office, I was able to walk around the city and make it back home. The pain started to settle in a little bit later, but it wasn’t so much that some Ibuprofen couldn’t take care of it. Toward the end, the doctor said that while there was a bit more bleeding, getting through the bone didn’t take too much effort. With overweight or obese patients, their bone densities can sometimes result in an actual hammer being needed to get the needle in (this doctor in particular was adamant about NOT using hammers for this, though).

After about 24 hours after the procedure, I finally got this email message from Forever Labs:

> Dear Matthew,
> Congratulations, your stem cells have been successfully processed for cryostorage. You now have access to a pool of your own stem cells that no longer biologically age. Here's a photograph of them!

Along with this photographic confirmation:

(what a lovely Christmas card)

So with that confirmation, all I need to do is wait 4-6 weeks for the bone marrow that was taken out of me to regenerate.
