Global warming was also the subject of a prominent talk with Andrew Ng. Between cryptocurrency mining and neural architecture search, people are becoming uncomfortably aware of the carbon footprints of their GPU-usage (and for me personally, this seems like an indication that CPU-based models like probabilistic models derived from NNs are going to be more and more important)

This past week was big. Those in the ML field know that this is when ICML is held.

Now all these trends are interesting and all, but this ICML was significant for another reason: It was also my very first machine learning conference ever where I had contributed to work being presented there. Because of this there were a few lessons and takeaways regarding my career in AI/ML itself that were reinforced by being at this conference:
- Find someone who you feel comfortable asking "dumb" questions
- Search for research inspiration in different places
- Invest in visualization tools and skills
- identify the math, engineering, and cognitive motivations of papers
- Conversations >> videos > papers > conference talks
- Learn to recognize and backtrack from dead-ends
- Don't get roped into hype
- Don't stop writing
- Mental and physical health are prerequisites for research
